			<p><br>Howdy! My name is Ethanael Joseph Ford, and I am a Junior Computer Science Major with a minor in Cybersecurity at Texas A&M!
      I love coding, going to the gym, playing volleyball with freinds, and creating things. 
      When playing volleyball I enjoy to be the setter, a position that holds a lot of directive control.
      Similarly, when working on projects I thrive as a leader and work well with others. I hope you get to know me a little better through this 
      little glimpse into my professional and personal life. <br><br>
      </p>
