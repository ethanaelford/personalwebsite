		<h2>Experiences -</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<h4>Code Combat / W3Schools:</h4> My coding journey started when i was 11 and my dad intorduced me to the world of JavaScript.
			I learned through websites such as Code Combat where I learned the basics of variables, loops, and functions. I then started 
			making basic web games using HTML and JavaScript, which I learned through W3Schools.
			</li>

			<li>
			<h4>Python RPG:</h4> When I was only 13 I started attending university level coding classes at my communit college. In one 
			of these classes I was tasked with making a working game in Python. I was the coding lead for my team and we were the only
			team at the end of the semester with a fully working game. The game had differend chachters with unique abilities, boss fights, 
			leveling up, and fully made art and sound. 
			</li>

			<li>
			<h4>Dungeon Level Design:</h4> Another project I was a part of during my time at San Jac was designing the layout
			and creating a dungeon in Unity3D. Although there was no code involved in this project, it helped sharpen other tools 
			at my disposal and gave me a better understanding of the process of game development. 
			</li>

			<li>
			<h4>Unity3D</h4> Over the years, I have learned Unity3D and have made several small projects including first 
			person platformers, and tiny puzzle games. 
			</li>

			<h4>FMYWN</h4> During my last semester at commuinty college, I was tasked with designing a product that we could sell.
			The product my team decided on  was "Forget Me You Will Not," a small and affordable tracker that you could put on anything such as your keys or wallet. 
			When you are far enough away from the tracker, your phone will alert you that you have forgoten the item and give you directions to them.
			This product would stop you from ever leaving your house again without the esentials. The Project ended up getting 1st place
			at the school and we each won a cash prize. 
			</li>

			<li>
			<h4>Redstone Warriors</h4> Throughout Highshool, I attened an FTC robotics club named "The Redstone Warriors." 
			On this team I held the roll of Lead Programmer. I was in charge of both the TeleOp and Autonomous. The Robots
			I worked on had multiple moving parts including the drive functionality, arms, and claws. Through the autonomous we 
			used sensors to precisely navigate the field and complete tasks. I also worked on other aspects of the robot including:
			leading the design, working on CAD, documenting the process through an engineering notebook, being the lead driver, and
			going to outreach events to help the next generations. Robotics is what has given me the love of problem solving and has
			taught me skills I will carry throughout my professional career. 
			</li>

			<li>
			<h4>Kings Vendetta</h4> My First major personal project was a turn based cared game Called Kings Vendetta (TM). The game
			features two opposing players who each have 10 cards in two even rows. Each team has to have a General Card and 9 other 
			either random or set. Each card has their own unique ability an health. Your goal is to kill the opposing teams general, through 
			attacking with dice. The game was super fun and had an amazing strategy element to it. I ended up designing over 100 unique cards
			and my uncle helped me program the base game. The game was made using JavaScript. We have since put a pause on the game but I hope to finish it up and publish it on the 
			app store in the future! 
			</li>

			<li>
			<h4>TODO List App</h4> A quick personal project I did in my sophmore year was a todo list game that rewards you for getting 
			things done throughout the day. It helped me learn how to use GameMaker Studios and was an easy project that I completed. Im not 
			sure if I will release it to the app store, but it was definitly a worth while experience. 
			</li>

			<li>
			<h4>Mystic Hand</h4> This was my latest personal project that I overtook during the Fall Semester of 2025. The game is a two person 
			mobile card game. The tempo is very fast and can be finished in 2-3 minutes. Each player has 24 cards, 3 of which are in their hand.
			Your goal is to either kill the other player (starts with 5 health), or get rid of all your cards. You have two passive slots where you can
			put modifier cards, or there is the play pile, where you can either discard or play cards into. This game was super fun to play
			and even more fun to make. I never figured out how to implement platform multiplayer but I hope in the future I can figure it out and 
			publish it to the app store. Through the project I did all the design, art, and coding. The skills I gained through making it will 
			help me complete Kings Vendetta in the future. 
			</li>

			<li>
			<h4>Carmels Bakery</h4> My sister and I have been working on a bakery together over the last couple years, and last
			summer I helped create the website. A small project, but a fun one none-the-less.
